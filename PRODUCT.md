# Blitzrechnung – Product Overview

## What is Blitzrechnung?

Blitzrechnung is an invoicing application for freelancers and small to medium-sized businesses in Germany. It provides a calm, focused environment for creating, managing, and sending professional invoices — without the complexity of traditional accounting software.

## The Problem

### Invoicing is more stressful than it should be

For many freelancers and small business owners, creating invoices is a dreaded task:

- **Overcomplicated tools** – Most invoicing software is bloated with features that small businesses don't need, making simple tasks feel overwhelming.

- **Fear of mistakes** – Invoice numbers, tax calculations, legal requirements — there's always the worry of getting something wrong.

- **Time-consuming process** – Switching between tools, looking up customer details, formatting PDFs — it all adds up.

- **Compliance anxiety** – German invoicing has specific legal requirements (§14 UStG), and upcoming e-invoicing mandates (ZUGFeRD/XRechnung) add another layer of complexity.

- **Context switching** – Many business owners handle invoicing at the end of a long day, when they're already tired and want to focus on other things.

## The Solution

### Invoicing that gets out of your way

Blitzrechnung takes a different approach: **do less, but do it well**.

#### Draft-First Workflow
Nothing happens automatically. Create invoices as drafts, review them at your own pace, and finalize only when you're ready. No accidental sends, no premature invoice numbers.

#### Calm, Focused Interface
A minimalist design that reduces cognitive load. No flashy dashboards, no notification overload — just the information you need, when you need it.

#### Built-in Compliance
Automatic validation ensures your invoices meet German legal requirements. ZUGFeRD-compliant PDFs are generated automatically, so you're ready for e-invoicing mandates.

#### Smart Defaults
Customer details, payment terms, and company information are saved and reused. Creating a new invoice takes seconds, not minutes.
